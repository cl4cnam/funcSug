# **FuncSug: GUI programming made easy**

FuncSug is an experimental scripting language that aims to simplify **GUI programming**.

[**Tutorials**](https://github.com/cl4cnam/funcSug/wiki/Tutorials) - [**Getting started**](https://github.com/cl4cnam/funcSug#instructions-for-use) - [**Examples**](https://github.com/cl4cnam/funcSug#get-a-taste-of-the-language) - [**REPL**](https://cl4cnam.github.io/FuncSugREPL/replPy.html) - [**Try it online**](https://cl4cnam.github.io/try_FuncSug)

## A few samples

### Play multiple sounds at the same time

```gdscript
parallel ||
	playSoundFile('sound1.mp3')
||
	playSoundFile('sound2.mp3')
||
	playSoundFile('sound3.mp3')
```

### Play multiple sounds one at a time

```gdscript
playSoundFile('sound1.mp3')
playSoundFile('sound2.mp3')
playSoundFile('sound3.mp3')
```

### Timeouts

```gdscript
displayNewMessage('What is ...?')
parallel exitAfter 1 finished ||
	var theAnswer := awaitHumanText()
||
	waitSeconds(15)
```
## How

FuncSug suppresses **event-driven programming** problems: **callback hell** and **state management**.

**Advantages:**
- It avoids *callback hell* (You don't need callback any more).
- Your code follows the order of execution so you avoid spaghetti code and debug more easily.
- It solves the [state management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_management) problem (It **eliminates** the need to manage **all the combinations** of component states).
- It easily manages task cancellations (including task timeouts).
- It can detect a change in the value of a variable and react accordingly.
- It's deterministic.
- (You can also include JavaScript snippets, pass FuncSug variables to it and get back JavaScript return).

**by means of**:
- explicit **logical parallelism**,
- block cancellations,
- and "`await` event" instructions.

      numberOfClick = 0
      console.log("Triple click")
      clearTimeout(timeoutID)
   }
}
$('launch').addEventListener('click', launch)
```

```python
awaitClickBeep('#launch')
parallel exitAfter 1 finished ||
   waitSeconds(30)
||
   while true:
      awaitClickBeep('#clickZone')
      parallel exitAfter 1 finished ||
         awaitClickBeep('#clickZone')
         awaitClickBeep('#clickZone')
         print("Triple click")
      ||
         waitSeconds(2)
         print("Non-triple click")
print("Good job! See you soon!")
```

If you copy and paste, replace each three initial spaces by one tabulation (Github markdown doesn't allow to change tabulation size in this context).

## Get a taste of the language
Have a look at:
- [the 'Make Gems' code](https://github.com/cl4cnam/make_gems/blob/main/makegemPhaserPy.fg)
or [try it](https://cl4cnam.github.io/make_gems/makegemPhaserPy.html).
- ['Guess the Number' code](https://github.com/cl4cnam/Guess_the_number/blob/main/guessTheNumberPy.fg)
or [try it](https://cl4cnam.github.io/Guess_the_number/guessTheNumberPy.html).
- ['Mini Sweet' code](https://github.com/cl4cnam/miniSweet/blob/main/miniSweetPy.fg)
or [try it](https://cl4cnam.github.io/miniSweet/miniSweetPy.html).
- ['Aquarium' code](https://github.com/cl4cnam/aquarium/blob/main/aquariumPy.fg)
or [try it](https://cl4cnam.github.io/aquarium/aquariumPy.html).
- ['Memory' code](https://github.com/cl4cnam/Memory/blob/main/memory.fg)
or [try it](https://cl4cnam.github.io/Memory/memory.html).
- ['Memory2' code](https://github.com/cl4cnam/Memory2/blob/main/memory.fg)
or [try it](https://cl4cnam.github.io/Memory2/memory.html).
- ['Hypertext fiction' code](https://github.com/cl4cnam/hypertextFictionExample/blob/main/hypertextFictionExample.fg)
or [try it](https://cl4cnam.github.io/hypertextFictionExample/hypertextFictionExample.html).

Look at the **global structure of the code**: One cannot follow this structure in usual programming language.

Let's take, for example, [the 'Make Gems' code](https://github.com/cl4cnam/make_gems/blob/main/makegemPhaserPy.fg):

In this language, there is no need to build a ball object, just call a function ```lifeOfBall```.
You just run multiple ```lifeOfBall```, ```birthOfGem``` and a ```lifeOfPaddle``` in parallel.
These functions do not build objects: they are just like any classical function.
<br>
In the body of ```lifeOfPaddle```, just code the various behaviors of the ball in parallel.

In ['Guess the Number'](https://github.com/cl4cnam/Guess_the_number/blob/main/guessTheNumber.fg), ```gameCourse``` is just a function. The line just after the call of ```gameCourse``` is executed only when the player has found the number, that is only when ```gameCourse``` has returned, just like any classical function call.

You can also test snippets [here](https://cl4cnam.github.io/FuncSugREPL/replPy.html).

## Concurrent way
![logo](https://github.com/cl4cnam/funcSug/assets/40176886/2d4c08b3-6f96-4acd-b993-b9bbe0df6b91)

FuncSug uses the "**concurrent way**" or more exactly the "**logically parallel way**". That is, it introduces explicit concurrency where no concurrency seems present or mandatory. The concurrency is reputed to be very difficult. However, amazingly, many cases (in particular concurrency of waits) are simpler with explicit concurrency!

With this style, you can program (as you program for the console) without users losing the multiple possibilities of interaction (Indeed, this style suppresses the *inversion of control* of the callback style of event-driven programming).

This "**concurrent way**" is expressed thanks to additional control flow instructions (beyond `if`, `while`, `for`,...):
- `parallel` / `parallel exitAfter ... finished` / `parallel(select ...)` / `parallel(for ... in ...)`,
- `select`,
- `spawn`,
- `whileTrue_dependsOn` / `whileTrueAwaitFrame_js` / `whileTrueAwaitDom_js`,
- `repeat`,
- `sequence`,
- ...

and with new modifiers (beyond `break`, `return`): `restart`, `pause`, `resume`.

That enables a better **structure of code** (that is, a more natural and more readable structure).

If you're curious, you can read the [the 'Memory' code](https://github.com/cl4cnam/Memory2/blob/main/memory.fg)
or [try it](https://cl4cnam.github.io/Memory2/memory.html) or read this [post](https://trio.discourse.group/t/structured-concurrency-for-gui-programming-without-concurrency/488).

It's loosely based on [SugarCubes](https://github.com/LordManta/SugarCubesJS) by Jean-Ferdy Susini which is a derivative of [Esterel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esterel) by GÃ©rard Berry. It adheres to "[structured concurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_concurrency)" principles. It doesn't use OS threads. It doesn't aim to improve speed of execution.

## Some features

### Parallel construct
> Beware that this is just a logical parallelism.

You can write
```
parallel ||
	<parallelBranch1>
||
	<parallelBranch2>
```
to execute ```parallelBranch1``` and ```parallelBranch2``` concurrently.

You can also:
- add a branch dynamically,
- select parallel branch(es) according to event(s).

### Interruptible block
You can interrupt (`break`), pause (`pause`), resume (`resume`) or restart (`restart`) a block. For example:
```
parallel ||
	@myBlock
	<instruction1>
	<instruction2>
||
	break myBlock
```
### Reaction to a change of a variable
You can react to a change of a variable, for example, like this:
```
while true:
	awaitBeep myVariable
	<whatToDoInThisCase>
```

## Syntax elements

The syntax is very similar to that of Python.

After the colon ```:``` of some blocks, you can add ``` @label ``` just after the function name to label the expression (This is useful for the ```break``` instruction).
This 'label' must be a declared variable.

## A few instructions/expressions (loose description)

```print(value)``` writes ```value``` onto the console.

```var variableName``` declares a new local variable.

```variableName := value``` assigns  ```value``` to ```variableName```.

```variableName += value``` increments  ```variableName``` by ```value``` (also for `-`,`*`,`/` operators).

```true``` and ```false``` returns the boolean value 'true' and 'false' respectively.

```value1 + value2``` returns the sum/concatenation of the two values (also for `-`,`*`,`/`,`mod`).

```value1 < value2``` returns the truth value of ```value1 < value2``` (also for `<=`,`=`,`/=`, `and`, `or`).

```randomIntBetween(value1, value2)``` returns a random integer between ```value1``` and ```value2```.

```if```, ```while```, ```def``` acts as usual in Python.

```break label``` interrupts the execution of the expression labelled by ```label```.

```
seq:
	expression1
	...
	expressionN
```
executes the expressions in sequence and returns the value of the last.

```
par:
	expression1
	...
	expressionN
```
executes the expressions in parallel.

```
onBreak:
	expression
```
executes ```expression``` if the preceding expression is interrupted.

```
js (variable1, ..., variableN):
	jsString
```
executes the code in ```jsString``` (in which ```variable1 ... variableN``` can be used).

```displayNewMessageIn(text cssSelector)``` displays a new message ```text``` into the DOM element identified by ```cssSelector```.

```displayNewMessageIn(text cssSelector/cssClass)``` displays a new message ```text``` into the DOM element identified by ```cssSelector``` and assigns ```cssClass``` to it.

```awaitNewHumanNumberIn(cssSelector)``` awaits a number from user in the DOM element identified by ```cssSelector```.

```awaitClickBeep(cssSelector)``` awaits a click from user in the DOM element identified by ```cssSelector```.

## Various

This language has [syntax highlighting for Geany](https://github.com/cl4cnam/funcSug/tree/main/tools/forGeany); otherwise, with Geany, if you choose that of zephir (or nsis, powershell, ruby), it can be pleasant.

The file ```parserPy.js``` has been generated online from the file ```funcSugPy.peggyjs``` on the site https://peggyjs.org/online.html with "parser variable" set to "pegPy".

For now, this implementation consists just in a quick and dirty interpreter but it works enough to be appreciated.

Work in progress.
