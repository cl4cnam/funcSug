# funcSug
Loosely based on https://github.com/LordManta/SugarCubesJS of Jean-Ferdy Susini.

Now, interactiveTest.html and guessTheNumber.html require a http server (for example, "php -S 127.0.0.1:8000" and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/interactiveTest.html and http://127.0.0.1:8000/guessTheNumber.html).

This language has no syntax highlighting, but if you choose that of zephir (or nsis, powershell, ruby) it can be pleasant.

In progress.
